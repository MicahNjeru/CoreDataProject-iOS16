#  Core Data Project iOS 16
## About this project
- This is a "learning" project in that no actual application was intended to be developed
- It will be a repo containing my sample code when learning on how to work with Swift, SwiftUI & Core Data


## What I've learnt
- Objects that conform to the `Hashable` protocol have unique hash values that Swift uses to differentiate similar objects
